              Initially, we were giving the challenge to make a solution to
              monitor multiple systems (servers, databases, file transfers) with
              a simple "online/offline" status.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              I designed a Figma prototype and collaborated with the backend
              team to use WebSockets for live updates. I made a Node.js
              middleware API to handle the WebSocket connections.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              Close to the deadline, we discovered our OpenShift infrastructure
              didnâ€™t support WebSockets.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              After some research, I learned about Server-Sent Events (SSE) as
              an alternative, and after adapting the middleware API to work with
              SSE, we were able to deliver the MVP.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              Challenge 2: Implemented a search bar that triggered too many API
              requests as the user typed.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              The solution was to implement a debounce to limit the number of
              requests, improving performance and user experience.
